# Fashion Sales Management System

Fashion Sales Management System is a lightweight, end-to-end sales and inventory platform tailored for small fashion retailers. It streamlines product, customer, and order management while providing actionable insights from customer ratings and recent sales to guide restocking and promotion decisions.

Key capabilities:
- Products, customers, and orders with search and filters in a clean UI.
- Inventory monitoring with low-stock alerts and minimum thresholds.
- Ratings (1â€“5) per product with averages and counts.
- Insights and predictions: best sellers, market summary (total revenue, total orders, average order value, top category), and nextâ€‘month demand forecast that blends 3â€‘month sales with a rating signal.
- Dashboard KPIs for atâ€‘aâ€‘glance status.
- Builtâ€‘in assistant chatbot to quickly navigate sections and surface insights.

Tech stack: Node.js, Express, and SQLite on the backend; HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript on the frontend. Authentication uses JWT with bcrypt hashing. The app ships with seed data and an admin account to help you explore it immediately.

Quick start:
```bash
npm install
cd server && npm install
cd .. && npm run server
# App: http://localhost:5000
```

Default login:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

This project emphasizes clarity and practicality over complexity. It is easy to run, simple to extend, and focused on turning dayâ€‘toâ€‘day transactions and customer sentiment into clear, dataâ€‘driven recommendations for what to stock, when to reorder, and where to focus promotions.
